# Upgrade Guide for CLI MCP Server

This guide explains the changes and improvements in version 0.2.2 of the CLI MCP Server, focusing on the enhancements to error handling that prevent the UI from freezing.

## What's New in v0.2.2

Version 0.2.2 focuses on robust error handling to prevent the server from freezing when commands fail or return unexpected responses. The key improvements include:

- **Enhanced error handling framework**
- **Improved sanitization of command output**
- **Robust response construction**
- **Better handling of timeouts and execution failures**

## Why These Changes Matter

The previous version of the server could freeze the UI in certain scenarios:

- When commands returned null or unexpected responses
- When timeouts occurred with certain command types
- When sanitization failed on unusual command output

These issues have been addressed in v0.2.2 with a comprehensive overhaul of the error handling system.

## Upgrading from v0.2.1

Upgrading to v0.2.2 is straightforward:

1. Replace the existing server.py file with the new version
2. No configuration changes are required
3. The improvements work with existing environment variables

## Testing Your Installation

A new test script (`test_server.py`) is included to verify that error handling is working correctly. Run it with:

```bash
python test_server.py
```

This will test various error conditions to ensure the server responds appropriately in all cases.

## Key Technical Changes

### 1. Enhanced Exception Classes

Exception classes now include more context and can carry structured error information:

```python
class CommandTimeoutError(CommandError):
    """Command timeout errors with attached error result object"""
    pass
```

### 2. Improved Output Sanitization

The sanitization function now handles a wider range of edge cases:

```python
def sanitize_output(output_text: str, max_length: int = 50000) -> str:
    # Robust handling of None values, non-string values, and more
    # ...
```

### 3. Robust Command Execution

Command execution now includes multiple layers of error handling:

```python
try:
    # Execute command
except subprocess.TimeoutExpired as e:
    # Create a valid error result that won't cause freezing
    error_result = subprocess.CompletedProcess(...)
    raise CommandTimeoutError(..., error_result)
```

### 4. Failsafe Response Construction

The response construction ensures valid responses in all cases:

```python
# Always include at least one item in the response
if not response:
    response.append(types.TextContent(type="text", text="Command executed but produced no output"))
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after upgrading:

1. Check the logs in `cli_mcp_server.log` for detailed error information
2. Run the test script to verify error handling is working
3. Ensure your environment variables are set correctly
